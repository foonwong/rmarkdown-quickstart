#### Introduction
Rmarkdown is a wonderful way to generate high quality reports for all your R projects.  Here's some resources and tips to help you get started.


## Quick Start
- Follow the wizard to create a new document.      
```{r, fig.retina=NULL, out.width=250, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('newfile.png')
```

#### Document structure
The default new file template explains the structure: 

1. *YAML header* in which you can specify your document metadata, output [formats](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html) and other global options.

2. [Text in markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html), which will be automatically converted into other formats: html, pdf, word documents and etc. The syntax is simple and you can learn all the basics in 5 minutes. [More on the basics here](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/#basic-formatting-in-r-markdown).

3. [R code chunks](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/#including-code) (**Ctrl + Alt + I **) R code can be easily inserted inline, or written in chunks. All code written in the chunks are executed when you knit the file. By default, both the code and output is displayed. 


```{r, fig.retina=NULL, out.width=600, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('default.png')
```

- Hit **Ctrl + Alt + K** to knit or render your document. Easy!

#### How it works
From rstudio:  

```{r, fig.retina=NULL, out.width=400, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-images/RMarkdownFlow.png")
```

The knit command processes the .rmd file using knitr(). All the code is executed and a markdown file is created. [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) does the rest of the magic converted the file to your desired output format.

## pdf and LaTeX
#### Software prerequisites
pdf documents are typesetted using LaTeX. Installation links:  
- [MikTex](https://miktex.org/download) (Windows) Download the "net installer" and choose complete installation (Large file!).

- [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) (Mac).

#### Using LaTeX packages
- If you need to use LaTeX packages, modify your YAML like so:

```

title: 'Homework I (Part II)'
author: "Foon Wong"
date: "February 4, 2018"
output: pdf_document
header-includes:
- \usepackage{amsmath}
- \usepackage{amssymb}
---
```

#### Math
Rmarkdown has support for a lot of LaTeX commands. Just like a regular TeX document, you can have:  
- inline math: surround your LaTeX code with a pair of `$`.  
- Longer blocks of math: write between `\[` and `\]`.

## Practical Tips

#### Global options
You can apply [options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) to your code chunks globally. I typically add the following in as my first code chunk:

```{r setup, echo = T}
# Hides all code except for output
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)
```


#### Organization and navigation
- Organize your document using headers. The character `#` means that the rest of the line is interpreted as a header. This allows you to quickly jump to (**Shift + Alt + J**) and hide (**Alt + O**) different sections of your document.

```{r, fig.retina=NULL, out.width=400, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('navigation.png')
```

- Name your code chunks. Facilitates navigation and troubleshooting.

#### Tables
- Use the packages [kable](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) and kableExtra to format your tables. It can do some really cool things in html.

#### Common problems

- [Newline doesn't start](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/#paragraph-breaks-and-forced-line-breaks) - paragraph breaks need a completely blank line. Forced line breaks require **two** blanks spaces at the end of the line.

- LaTeX Math: LaTeX rendering can be *very sensitive* to spacing. If you have newlines in between `$'s, it may break. 

#### Hotkeys 

- **Ctrl + Shift + K**: knits the text file to your desired output format.  
- **Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)**: Inserts a r code chunk.    
- **Ctrl + Shift + Enter**: Execute a code chunk.   
- **Shift + Alt + J**: Navigation.
